### AI Notifeye (Driver Safety Camera Device) üìΩÔ∏è
---

I coded a camera software using AI Facemesh technology that will track the human eye and founded Notifeye as part of my Business Incubator class in my junior year in High School. Notifeye won the first place in the Nationals Incubatoredu competition and was incorporated into a company. To get an idea of how Notifeye works, please see the following video.
