## AI Projects 🤖

### 1. **AI Notifeye (Driver Safety Camera Device)** 📽️
  I coded a camera software using AI Facemesh technology that will track the human eye and founded Notifeye
  as part of my Business Incubator class in my junior year in High School. Notifeye won the first place in 
  the Nationals Incubatoredu competition and was incorporated into a company. 
  To get an idea of how Notifeye works, please see the following video.

  - **Purpose** Save lives by notifying the driver if they are drowsy or distracted
  - **Application**: Driver Safety
  - **Technologies**: AI Facemesh, OpenCV

### 2. **AI Face Tracking Drone (For FedEx)** 📽️
  I coded a face tracking software to control a drone 
  To get an idea of how Notifeye works, please see the following video.
  
  [![**Notifeye Code Demo**](https://img.youtube.com/vi/gDkTH1WnpPI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDkTH1WnpPI)
  
  - **Purpose** Track the human face and follow it
  - **Application**: Delivery of Fedex packages via drones to the correct person
  - **Technologies**: AI Facemesh, OpenCV

### 3. **AI Video Transcriber** 📽️
  In this project, I use OpenAI's Whisper API to transcribe videos to text.
  - **Purpose** Use OpenAI's Speech to Text Whisper API to transcribe text
  - **Application**: Useful to transcribe professor videos to text so you can take the transcript and summarize it with a fast read
  - **Technologies**: OpenAI Whisper, FFMPEG, Jupyter notebook
  ```
  Detecting language using up to the first 30 seconds. Use `--language` to specify the language
  Detected language: English
  [00:00.000 --> 00:24.580]  I'm at the foot of the ladder. The LAM footbeds are only depressed in the surface about one or two inches, although the surface appears to be very, very fine-grained as you get close to it. It's almost like a powder. Ground mass is very fine.
  [00:30.000 --> 00:38.240]  Yeah, I'm going to step off the LAM now.
  [00:47.520 --> 00:55.280]  That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.
  [01:00.000 --> 01:01.520]  Yeah, I'm going to step off the LAM.
  ```

### 4. **AI Phishing URL Detector** 📽️
![Gandalf The Wise](4-ai-phishing-url-detector/gandalf-thou-shalt-not-phish.png)
In this project, I use Machine Learning to train a model using malicious URL data and then use the model to predict if a link that is sent is a phishing or malicious link or not. 
  
  - **Purpose** Detect hacker attempts to phish (steal) information
  - **Application**: Use to protect users by against phishing threats
  - **Technologies**: sci-kit-learn, numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter notebook
  
  Open juptyer notebook to see how the code works
  Remember the words of the wise - Gandalf the Wise!

### 5. **AI Self-Driving Cars** 🚗 
  In this project, I use Machine Learning and OpenCV to have the car camera detect lanes and extrapolate the lanes for self-driving
  - **Purpose** Autonomous (self-driving) 
  - **Application**: Humanless transportation
  - **Technologies**: sci-kit-learn, numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter notebook

### 4. **AI Drone Path Planning** 🛸🧭
