## AI Projects ü§ñ

### 1. **AI Notifeye (Driver Safety Camera Device)** üìΩÔ∏è
  I coded a camera software using AI Facemesh technology that will track the human eye and founded Notifeye
  as part of my Business Incubator class in my junior year in High School. Notifeye won the first place in 
  the Nationals Incubatoredu competition and was incorporated into a company. 
  To get an idea of how Notifeye works, please see the following video.

  - **Purpose** Save lives by notifying the driver if they are drowsy or distracted
  - **Application**: Driver Safety
  - **Technologies**: AI Facemesh, OpenCV

### 1. **AI Video Transcriber** üìΩÔ∏è
  In this project, I use OpenAI's Whisper API to transcribe videos to text.
  - **Purpose** Use OpenAI's Speech to Text Whisper API to transcribe text
  - **Application**: Useful to transcribe professor videos to text so you can take the transcript and summarize it with a fast read
  - **Technologies**: OpenAI Whisper, FFMPEG, Jupyter notebook

### 2. **AI Phishing URL Detector** üìΩÔ∏è
  In this project, I use Machine Learning to train a model using malicious URL data and then use the model to predict if a link that is sent is a phishing or malicious link or not. 
  - **Purpose** Detect hacker attempts to phish (steal) information
  - **Application**: Use to protect users by against phishing threats
  - **Technologies**: sci-kit-learn, numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter notebook
