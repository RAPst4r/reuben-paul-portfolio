      "[01:14.520 --> 01:18.920]  where he has developed a keen eye for identifying the ways in which speakers can improve their\n",
      "[01:18.920 --> 01:24.440]  confidence, clarity and competence in communicating to a variety of audiences.\n",
      "[01:24.440 --> 01:29.080]  Dr. Ford is especially interested in how leaders might communicate more effectively\n",
      "[01:29.080 --> 01:33.960]  and how various approaches to leadership shape leaders' communication. He has published research\n",
      "[01:33.960 --> 01:38.360]  in the Journal of Business Communication and Corporate Communication that investigated\n",
      "[01:38.360 --> 01:43.800]  questions about how work context influenced organizational members' identification with\n",
      "[01:43.800 --> 01:48.280]  organizations. More recently, he has turned his attention to learning more about how groups make\n",
      "[01:48.600 --> 01:52.280]  decisions, provide effective feedback and communicate through conflicts. So,\n",
      "[01:52.280 --> 01:59.320]  please welcome Dr. Jacob Ford. Hi, thank you all for having me today. It's such an honor\n",
      "[01:59.320 --> 02:05.080]  to speak with you all, and I'm very excited to talk about this topic. I'm not sure if it's\n",
      "[02:05.080 --> 02:09.400]  one that's come up in any other classes, but we're going to take kind of a deep dive here\n",
      "[02:09.400 --> 02:15.960]  on this idea of organizational values and how that relates to developing, establishing positive\n",
      "[02:15.960 --> 02:23.880]  and helpful organizational cultures in our organizations. So, the impetus for this topic\n",
      "[02:23.880 --> 02:29.720]  kind of came across these and started from these two words, espoused and enacted values.\n",
      "[02:30.520 --> 02:35.400]  So, this came through some research I had been reading, some conversations with students and\n",
      "[02:35.400 --> 02:41.160]  colleagues, really examining kind of this tension that is inherent in a lot of organizations where\n",
      "[02:41.160 --> 02:46.120]  organizations want to have certain values and they state these values, these espoused values,\n",
      "[02:46.120 --> 02:51.880]  stated values, but then it's really difficult for these organizations to live out or enact these\n",
      "[02:51.880 --> 02:59.080]  values. And so, as leaders and future leaders in organizations, I think this topic is particularly\n",
      "[02:59.080 --> 03:05.080]  relevant for you all today as well. So, as you find yourselves managing teams and organizations\n",
      "[03:05.080 --> 03:10.600]  and departments and divisions, you'll have a significant impact on organizational cultures\n",
      "[03:10.680 --> 03:16.760]  and also their value system. So, today we'll actually dive deeper into organizational values\n",
      "[03:16.760 --> 03:22.280]  and look at their complexity. It's a lot more complex than just kind of simply brainstorming\n",
      "[03:22.280 --> 03:27.240]  or desiring certain values for your organization to have and making a list on the website. So,\n",
      "[03:27.240 --> 03:32.440]  today we're going to go a lot deeper into that. There's much more to developing organizations\n",
      "[03:32.440 --> 03:36.520]  culture, and I want you all to be effective leaders who understand the importance of kind\n",
      "[03:36.520 --> 03:42.040]  of aligning these stated values that we put on our websites and on our walls and our organizations,\n",
      "[03:42.040 --> 03:47.320]  but also with those that are kind of lived out by organizational members. That's my goal for today,\n",
      "[03:47.320 --> 03:52.680]  and I hope that is particularly helpful for you all. So, when we talk about organizational values,\n",
      "[03:52.680 --> 03:56.360]  we can't really separate this out from organizational culture. I'll refer to this\n",
      "[03:56.360 --> 04:00.840]  again later in the talk and something that's a common theme today that's difficult to tease\n",
      "[04:00.840 --> 04:06.280]  these two terms apart. Anytime we're talking about organizational culture, you know, this is\n",
      "[04:06.280 --> 04:10.280]  going to be something that's hard to define as well. It can be an ambiguous term or it's hard\n",
      "[04:10.280 --> 04:15.560]  to know exactly what creates an organization's culture, how it's maintained and established\n",
      "[04:15.560 --> 04:20.520]  over time. And so, in order to help with this challenge, I wanted to provide an image,\n",
      "[04:20.520 --> 04:25.080]  a metaphor, if you will, to look at this particular topic. So, believe it or not,\n",
      "[04:25.080 --> 04:30.920]  I'm not the first person to ever use an iceberg as a metaphor for a topic, but I think it applies\n",
      "[04:30.920 --> 04:36.360]  appropriately to what we're talking about discussing today. The iceberg, in our case today,\n",
      "[04:36.360 --> 04:42.760]  represents two aspects of organizational culture. And the first is going to be this idea of that\n",
      "[04:42.760 --> 04:47.960]  part of an organization's culture are those artifacts and behaviors that we see. And so,\n",
      "[04:47.960 --> 04:51.480]  these are most of the time what we're talking about organizational culture, we're talking about how\n",
      "[04:51.480 --> 04:56.360]  people are behaving, how people are communicating with one another, what stories we tell, what\n",
      "[04:57.000 --> 05:02.200]  logos we have, what image are we presenting. All of that falls under this category of artifacts\n",
      "[05:02.200 --> 05:08.120]  and behaviors, the things we can see. But really, the second part of the iceberg, the part underneath\n",
      "[05:08.920 --> 05:14.600]  that creates this culture are our values and basic assumptions. And so, that's where we're\n",
      "[05:14.600 --> 05:20.920]  going today is we're going to try to engage this deeper part of an organization's culture\n",
      "[05:20.920 --> 05:26.520]  that is represented by our values and basic assumptions. So, we can see evidence of our\n",
      "[05:26.520 --> 05:31.720]  culture through our behaviors and our different actions that we have in organizations, the stories\n",
      "[05:31.720 --> 05:37.480]  we tell, but we can trace each one of those artifacts and behaviors and heroes of our\n",
      "[05:37.480 --> 05:43.400]  organizations to some value, some moral, some basic assumption about life and how we should\n",
      "[05:43.400 --> 05:47.960]  get along in an organization. And so, today we're going to talk more about those values and those\n",
